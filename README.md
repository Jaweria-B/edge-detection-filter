# ✨ Edge Detection Filter App ✨

Welcome to the Magical Image Filter App, where we sprinkle a touch of magic on your pictures! 🌈✨

## What is this?

This app is here to bring your images to life with a dazzling **Edge Detection Filter**! 🚀 Simply upload your images, and watch as the app applies a special filter that enhances the edges, making your pictures pop with flair! 🌟

## How Does It Work?

The secret sauce behind this magic is the **Edge Detection Kernel**. 🧙‍♂️✨ We've conjured up a special 3x3 matrix that, when applied to your images, accentuates the edges and highlights the enchanting details. 🎩✨

The mystical formula is as follows:

```
[-1, -1, -1]
[-1,  8, -1]
[-1, -1, -1]
```

This kernel creates a spellbinding effect that's perfect for giving your images an extra dose of charm! 🌌🔮

## How to Use:

1. 📷 **Upload Your Images:** Click the "Choose multiple images..." button to upload your favorite pictures. Bring on the magic moments! 🌈🖼️

2. 🚀 **Witness the Transformation:** Each uploaded image will showcase its original glory and then reveal its transformed self after the edge detection magic is applied. Prepare to be amazed! 🌟🎉

3. 📸 **Share the Magic:** Once you've experienced the magic, feel free to share your newly enchanted images with friends and family! Spread the joy and excitement! 🌟💖
